SPARS - Scalable Paging Automatic Relay System
1. Introduction
System Name: SPARS (Scalable Paging Automatic Relay System)
Developer: Joe Greening
Purpose: To enhance the situational awareness and response times of emergency service personnel in New Zealand.

2. Background
Emergency services in New Zealand rely on a combination of the AMS app and a traditional pager system for communication. Each has its limitations:

AMS App: Known for occasional delays in notifications, which can affect the timeliness of emergency responses.
Pager System: Limited to station-specific communication, which hinders coordination between different emergency services.
To overcome these challenges, SPARS has been developed to intercept and relay pager messages across the country, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response.

3. Objectives
Increase Notification Speed: Enhance the speed at which emergency alerts are delivered to personnel.
Improve Cross-Agency Communication: Facilitate better coordination between fire and ambulance services.
Enhance Situational Awareness: Provide real-time updates and alerts to emergency responders.
4. How SPARS Works
Intercepting Pager Messages:

SPARS captures all pager messages broadcasted nationwide. This includes messages that are traditionally locked to specific stations.
Relaying Alerts:

The system processes these messages and forwards them to designated users based on their configuration settings. Users receive timely notifications about incidents relevant to their roles and locations.
Pre-Alerting Fire Personnel:

SPARS pre-alerts firemen about incoming ambulance calls, particularly for high-priority (purple) calls. This ensures that fire teams are aware of critical situations in advance and can prepare for rapid deployment.
User Configuration:

Users can customize their alert preferences through the SPARS interface. They can specify which fire calls and ambulance messages they wish to receive, set priority levels, and maintain a blacklist to filter out irrelevant notifications.
Integration with Existing Systems:

By integrating with the existing pager and notification systems, SPARS bridges the communication gap between fire and ambulance services, providing a unified view of emergency incidents.
5. Benefits
Reduced Response Times: By pre-alerting fire personnel about ambulance calls, SPARS allows for quicker preparation and response to emergencies.
Improved Situational Awareness: Emergency responders receive comprehensive and timely updates, enhancing their ability to manage incidents effectively.
Enhanced Coordination: SPARS facilitates better communication and coordination between fire and ambulance services, leading to more efficient emergency response operations.
6. Use Cases
Case 1: Fire Response to Ambulance Calls

Scenario: An ambulance responds to a life-threatening (purple) call. Fire personnel are pre-alerted by SPARS and can quickly mobilize in anticipation of the ambulance’s arrival.
Outcome: Fire teams are better prepared, reducing the overall response time and improving the efficiency of the emergency response.
Case 2: Nationwide Pager Message Relay

Scenario: A significant incident occurs in a remote location, and the local pager system sends out alerts. SPARS intercepts these messages and forwards them to all relevant emergency personnel across the country.
Outcome: Emergency responders nationwide receive critical updates, ensuring that all relevant personnel are informed and can act accordingly.
7. Conclusion
SPARS represents a significant advancement in emergency communication for New Zealand. By addressing the limitations of existing systems and providing a scalable, automated solution, SPARS enhances the speed, coordination, and effectiveness of emergency responses. The system’s ability to integrate with current technologies and offer customizable alert settings makes it a valuable tool for improving situational awareness and response times for emergency service personnel.
