# SPARS - Scalable Paging Automatic Relay System

## Developer: Joe Greening
## Purpose: To enhance the situational awareness and operational efficiency of emergency service personnel in New Zealand.


## To use SPARS follow the instructions at the link below:
https://github.com/SPARS-NZ/SPARS

## Background
Emergency services in New Zealand rely on a combination of the AMS app and a traditional pager system for communication. Each has its limitations:

AMS App: Known for occasional delays in notifications, which can affect the timeliness of emergency responses.
Pager System: Limited to station-specific communication, which hinders coordination between emergency services.

To overcome these challenges, SPARS has been developed to intercept and relay pager messages across the country, improving the operational efficiency of personnel.

## Objectives
- Increase Notification Speed: Enhance the speed at which emergency alerts are delivered to personnel.
- Improve Cross-Agency Communication: Facilitate better coordination between fire and ambulance services.
- Enhance Situational Awareness: Provide real-time updates and alerts to emergency responders.

## How SPARS Works
Intercepting Pager Messages:

SPARS captures all pager messages broadcasted nationwide. This includes messages that are traditionally locked to specific stations.

### Relaying Alerts:

The system processes these messages and forwards them to designated users based on their configuration settings. Users receive timely notifications about incidents relevant to their roles and locations.

### Pre-Alerting Personnel:

SPARS pre-alerts personnell about incoming calls, particularly for high-priority calls. This ensures that crews are aware of critical situations in their vincinity.

### User Configuration:

Users can customize their alert preferences through the SPARS interface. They can specify which fire calls and ambulance messages they wish to receive, set priority levels, and maintain a blacklist to filter out irrelevant notifications.

### Integration with Existing Systems:

By integrating with the existing pager and notification systems, SPARS bridges the communication gap between fire and ambulance services, providing a unified view of emergency incidents.

## Benefits
- Reduced Response Times: By pre-alerting personnel about calls, SPARS allows for quicker response to emergencies.
- Improved Situational Awareness: personnel receive comprehensive and timely updates, enhancing their ability to manage incidents effectively.
- Enhanced Coordination: SPARS facilitates better communication and coordination between fire and ambulance services, leading to more efficient operations.

## Example Use Cases

Scenario: An ambulance responds to a life-threatening (purple) call. Communication is delayed between Ambulance and Fire Communications Centres. Fire personnel are pre-alerted by SPARS and are aware of a incoming call.
Outcome: Crews are better prepared, reducing the overall response time and improving the efficiency of the emergency response.

Scenario: A Fire Investigator is Oncall, He is notified by SPARS about a calls that he may need to attend and is able to keep a finger on pulse of their district.
Outcome: The Fire Investigator receives updates and pre-alerts to calls potentially requiring investigation, allowing for their timely response, communication and co-ordination with crews at the incident and better time management for those working on call.

## Conclusion
SPARS represents a small advancement in emergency communication. By addressing the limitations of existing systems and providing a scalable, automated solution, SPARS enhances the operational efficiency of personnel. The system’s ability to integrate with current technologies and offer customizable alert settings makes it a valuable tool for improving situational awareness and response times for emergency service personnel.
